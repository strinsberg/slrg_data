"""This will be a script to filter out a certain group of users from
a codeforces users list. Preferably one that has been gendered fully.
It might also be worth processing that list first to find out what all
the first names are that are available and possibly trying a different
method for obtaining gender labels to see what we can get. The
processing may end up being a script and it may end up just being something
I do, and just keep the user data.
