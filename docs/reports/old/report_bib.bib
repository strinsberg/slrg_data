abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The increased interest in analyzing and explaining gender inequalities in tech, media, and academia highlights the need for accurate inference methods to predict a person's gender from their name. Several such services exist that provide access to large databases of names, often enriched with information from social media profiles, culture-specific rules, and insights from sociolinguistics. We compare and benchmark five name-to-gender inference services by applying them to the classification of a test data set consisting of 7,076 manually labeled names. The compiled names are analyzed and characterized according to their geographical and cultural origin. We define a series of performance metrics to quantify various types of classification errors, and define a parameter tuning procedure to search for optimal values of the services' free parameters. Finally, we perform benchmarks of all services under study regarding several scenarios where a particular metric is to be optimized.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
