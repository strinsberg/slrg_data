\section{Introduction}
% What are we doing?
The goal of this project is to collect source code samples from individual authors from various online sources. It requires finding samples that have certain sociolinguistic characteristics such as gender, region, and experience. In addition to sociolinguistic characteristics, it is necessary that the samples are the work of only a single author. Data that meets these needs is being collected and used to create a dataset with information on authors and their source code.

% Why are we doing it?
The collected data will be used for sociolinguistic research into how people use programming languages. Current and future University of Lethbridge students will use this research to learn how sociolinguistic characteristics affect how programmers write code. Previous research was conducted with a small dataset of student programs. This new dataset will contain many samples from a larger set of programmers.

% What is coming in this documents?
The document is broken into three main sections. Each section details one of the sources that was used to collect data. First, the collection methods used to gather source code from GitHub. Then, the methods used to collect source code from Codeforces. Lastly, the methods that were used to add gender data to the samples collected.

Each section introduces the sources and collection methods. Then it discusses the pros and cons of the source. Next an overview of the process of collecting data is given, with diagrams to help visualize it. Following this a more in depth technical examination of the collection process takes place. Finally, some reflection on the source is given (if needed?).


% GitHub %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Collecting Source Code From GitHub}


%& Introduction to the sources being used
\subsection{Data Sources}
\subsubsection*{GitHub}
GitHub is one of the largest online code sharing/hosting website on the internet with over 36 million users and over 100 million repositories \cite{WEBSITE:Git1}. It has an API that allows access to information on users, repositories, commits, and more(?Jackies comment was not clear on etc. but I assume it is no good. Whats better?). Source code hosted in public repositories is available for anyone to freely access or use in projects. Data on users, as well as source code is collected from GitHub and added to the database. Two methods are used for this. The first looks at commit data and collects changes to files. The second looks at projects and collects full files of source code. Both support the goal of adding single author source code samples to the database.

\subsubsection*{GhTorrent}
GhTorrent is an offline database of data obtained from the GitHub API \cite{Gousi13}. It contains large quantities of data on GitHub users, projects, commits from as far back as 2012. This data is being collected to support research on software repositories and is available to the public for other research on GitHub. This source is used to collect information on GitHub commits and projects. We use this information to decide what projects and commits to attempt to collect source code samples from GitHub (clumsy). More information is available at http://ghtorrent.org.

\subsubsection*{Google BigQuery}
Google BigQuery is a part of the Google Cloud Platform. It allows the storage and querying of datasets online. These datasets and query results can be connected to other google cloud services and also downloaded. The GhTorrent dataset is accessible on BigQuery. Queries on the GhTorrent dataset are made  using and refined using BigQuery in order to find information on the desired commits and projects.


%% Pros and Cons of each along with steps taken to try and overcome any issues.
\subsection{Pros And Cons}
\subsubsection*{GitHub}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The popularity of GitHub means that there is a large amount of source code and data available. This means one can get a reasonable amount of data on even very specific searches.

    \item It's api is full featured and well documented. It can be used to find any information that is available on the website. Except source code which must be obtained in other ways.
    
    \item The nature of the platform makes all public code freely available for anyone to access within the platform. This is outlined in the GitHub terms of service (reference). However, without and open source license source code is still the sole property of the author and cannot be shared or published without their permission.

    \item GitHub is often used for collaboration. It is not always easy to tell wether source code has a single author, but there are contributor lists and other tools that can help \cite{Yang2017}\cite{Matyukhina2019}. However, results from the these tools might not be accurate when used on projects that were added to GitHub long after being stated. It is also possible for code in a repository to be taken from a 3rd party source like libraries, extensions, or freely available code samples.

    \item A Rate limit of 5000 calls per hour is imposed on the GitHub API. By collecting the initial data from GhTorrent the number of API calls is reduced. It is not hard for a process to use up this limit in much less time than 1 hour. If a process will use up the limit it is necessary to have it keep track of time and wait for the API to reset every hour.

    \item When collecting code from commits the changes can be scattered around a file. It is not very useful to have 30 lines of code from an author if those 30 lines are not connected to one another. It is possible to identify changes that are part of a newly added file. This ensures that all the changes represent a single piece of code. One of the issues with this is that newly added files are often not complete.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{GhTorrent}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The GhTorrent database is a massive database of GitHub metadata. Accessing GitHub metadata using GhTorrent can make it much easier to know what kind of data is available on GitHub.
    
    \item Because the GhTorrent database is so big it would be difficult to store it locally. Queries on a database of this size would be slow without good hardware. So for most people access must be through another source like Google BigQuery. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Google BigQuery}
\begin{itemize}
    \item BigQuery is run with Googles code platform. The hardware used to process queries will run queries on the GhTorrent database much faster than the hardware most people have access to.

    \item Because BigQuery is part of the Google cloud platform it requires a google account to use. There are also limits on the amount of data that can be queried each month and limits on how much data a person can store. It is possible to increase these limits with payment if needed.

    \item BigQuery also has a limit on how many rows of data can be downloaded at once. This can make it more time consuming to download the results of large queries. Details of this process can be found below.
\end{itemize}


%% High level overview of the process w/ diagrams
\subsection{Process Overview}

%%% Ght and BigQuery process
\subsubsection*{GhTorrent and Google BigQuery}
SQL queries are made on the GhTorrent dataset via BigQuery. These queries are refined until the results are satisfactory. Once desired results are obtained they can be saved or downloaded. It is often best to save the results of a large query and then sample it with another query. These sample results can then be split and downloaded. If the results were split they can be recombined before being processed by one of the collection methods for GitHub. See Figure 1.

%%% Git projects process
\subsubsection*{Collecting Git Projects}
The list of GitHub project data collected from GhTorrent is loaded and each entry is processed. If the project referenced by an entry is valid its repository is cloned locally. Then every valid folder is searched to find valid single author files. All valid files are then processed by having their source code collected and further validated. If the source code is valid it is added, along with user and project information, to the database. Once a project is finished being processed the cloned repository is removed. See Figure 2.

\end{figure}

%%% Git commits process
\subsubsection*{Collecting Git Commits}
The list of GitHub commit data collected from GhTorrent data is loaded and each entry is processed. First the entry's commit information is requested from the GitHub API. If this information is available, all the files that have changes are validated. If a set of changes is valid it is collected and has any extra symbols that were added by GitHub removed. Then the source code is added, along with user, project, and commit information, to the database.  See Figure 3.

%% Discussion of each subprocess
\subsection{Process Details}

%%% Ght and BigQuery process
\subsubsection{GhTorrent and Google BigQuery}

\subsubsection*{Process}
The GhTorrent database is accessed via BigQuery at\linebreak
https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/ghtorrent-bq:ght. From here SQL queries are made on the database to find data for users, projects, and commits. The exact queries depend on which collection method is being used. Both collection methods collect only one programming language at a time, so queries filter out all but the desired language. Since research is being done on region records where country code is NULL are filtered out. These queries run quite quickly and are refined until only the desired results are obtained.

Results are saved to a table in the users personal datasets. A dataset and table can be created to save the results of any query. Though there are only 10GB available in the free tier. Once saved if the results are too big then they are randomly sampled to reduce their size. To build our dataset approximately 150,000 records per programming language were collected. This allowed 6-10,000 users who's combined samples had 300 or more lines of code. When a sample is taken it is saved to a table so it can be downloaded within the constraints of BigQuery.

The final table of results is able to be downloaded with a maximum of 10,000 rows at a time. The table is queried with SQL that allows it to be broken up into pieces that are downloaded as json files. Once each section of 10,000 records has been downloaded as json files they are combined with a script into one or more data files. These resulting data files are formatted so they are can be parsed by Python3's json library and loaded by our scripts.

\subsubsection*{Data}
The downloaded json files have each row of the query represented as a json record on it's own line. Each record is a collection of key value pairs, where the key is the column name. Because the records are not contained in a list they must be pre-processed before they can be loaded with Python3's json library. This is taken care of by the script that combines the downloaded results into one or more data files. Once processed each record is an entry in a list that can be iterated over. The columns in each record can be accessed by their corresponding column name from the SQL query that created them. The Fields for a user's company, state, city, and location are allowed to be NULL for our collection processes. The fields necessary for each process differ and will be described in the process's Data section.

%%% Git projects process
\subsubsection{Collecting Git Projects}
% Removed this introduction, but should there be a section devoted to the pros and cons of each process, and maybe describing the goals of that process?
\subsubsection*{Process}
First a file containing a list of project records collected from the GhTorrent dataset via BigQuery is loaded. For each project record an attempt is made to add the users full name and their gender. The name is collected by using the GitHub API for user information. If there is a full name the first name is extracted and passed to a gender checking function. This function calls a gender API to obtain gender information. If name or gender cannot be added to the project record the process moves on to the next record. If both name and gender are found they are added to the record. Next, a call to the GitHub API is made to get a list of contributors to the project. If there are more than one contributors to a project the process continues with the next project record.

If name, gender, and contributors are successfully added to the record the script clones the project repository into a temporary directory. The repository is searched to find all files that were only contributed to by the project owner. To attempt to limit the collection of files added from other sources some directories are excluded from the search. For example, lib, ext, and samples and other variations of these directory names are ignored \cite{Matyukhina2019}. There is also a list of files that are not included. This depends on the programming language. For example {\_\_}init{\_\_}.py files in Python packages. Files that are not ignored are checked to make sure they have an extension that matches the programming language being collected. The files are also checked with git blame to determine if more than one author contributed to them \cite{Wisse2015}. Because the record only contains information on the repository owner collected only files where the author is the same as the repository owner are collected. When all files have been checked a list of file paths for the valid files is returned.

The source code is collected from each file in the list of valid files. The number of lines in the source code is counted. Any file with less than 10 lines or more than 1000 lines is ignored. Valid source code, the filename, and number of lines to the project record are collected together. A hash of the file path in the repository is made to be used along with the project id to create a unique key to prevent duplicate files from being collected. Once all this information has been collected it is added, along with all information contained in the project record, to the database. After all the valid files have been added to the database the process continues for the next project record.

When all project records are processed or a given limit for number of records to process is reached the process ends. Details on the range of records processed and the success rate for project and added files are displayed.

\subsubsection*{Data}
Data is collected for the user, project, and each file. The required user information collected is GitHub login, full name, country code, gender, and gender probability. All of these are collected as strings except for gender probability which is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. All of these fields will be present on any project record that is stored in the database. Other data collected on the user includes company, city, state, location, type, and time created. All of these are strings except for the time created which is a time stamp. These fields are not required for collection and can NULL. The time stamp will most likely always be there even though it is not required.

The project information collected is project name, GitHub API url, programming language, and creation time. All of these fields are required and will always be present when making queries on the GhTorrent dataset vis BigQuery. All these fields are all strings except the creation time which is a time stamp. The programming language is the primary programming language used on the project and the project repository may contain files of other types.

File information is gathered during the processing of a project record. It include the source code, number of source code lines, file path within the repository, and a hash of the file path. All these fields are strings except for the source code lines which is an integer. These fields are required for a sample to be added to the database.

\subsubsection*{Technical Issues}
There are a number of calls to external services while collecting samples from GitHub projects. It can be difficult to properly handle all of the possible responses and connection issues. This makes it difficult to automate the process in a way that it can be guaranteed to run for long periods unattended.

In order to process each file for it's contents and check the number of contributors it is necessary to clone the project repository. If a project is large or has media files it can take a long time to download. This can slow down collection and use a large amount of bandwidth. Many projects are cloned and don't result in any files being collected. By filtering projects for single contributors there are fewer large projects being collected, but it is not fool proof.


%%% Git commits process
\subsubsection{Collecting Git Commits}

\subsubsection*{Process}
First a file of commit records collected from the GhTorrent dataset via BigQuery is loaded. Like the GitHub projects collection an attempt is made to collect information for name and gender. If found this information is added to the commit record. If no name and gender information is found the process continues with the next commit record.

For each commit record a request is made to the GitHub API to collect the details of the commit. The response to this request contains information on every file that was a part of the commit. Each file has a file name and is marked as being modified or added. It also has the text for each line that was changed. Changes to modified files can be spread around the file and it is not clear if a whole line was changed or just some parts of it. For this reason only files marked as added are collected. This way the code collected was all guaranteed to be added by the author of the commit. It is still difficult to be sure that the commit author wrote the new file before adding it.

Each file in the commit data response is validated. As stated above it must be an added file. It must also have more than 10 changes, which corresponds to 10 lines of source code. The file name is also examined to make sure it has an extension that is for the programming language being collected. If a file meets all of these conditions then it's source is collected.

The commit data response has some some text added to it that is not part of the source code. A header is added that contains information on the number of additions and deletions to the file during this commit. This header is removed from the source code. Also, because the changes show the differences between a file and its previous iteration each line has a + or - at the start. Since only added files are collected all lines are preceded by a +. All of these are also cleaned out of the source code before adding it to the database.

The cleaned source code is collected along with the number of file changes. These are added to the database with all the information from the commit record.
Once each valid file in the commit response is added to the database the process continues with the next commit record.

When all commit records are processed or a given limit for number of records to process is reached the process ends. Details on the range of records processed and the success rate for commits and added files are displayed.

\subsubsection*{Data}
Data is collected for the user, project, commit, and each file. The user and project information is the same as the GitHub projects process. The information collected for the commit is commit SHA, and creation time. The SHA is a unique string identifier for the commit generated by GitHub and the creation time is a time stamp indicating when the commit was made. Both are required information and should be present in the commit record collected from the GhTorrent dataset via BigQuery.

The file information is also the same as the projects process except that file lines is replaced with file changes and the status of the file is collected. The changes are an integer and the status is a string. Both are collected when processing the commit data response from the GitHub API and they are required in order to add a source code sample to the database.



% Codeforces %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Collecting Source Code From Codeforces}


%% Introduction to the source being used %%
\subsection{Sources}
Codeforces is a website that hosts programming contests and allows users to submit solutions to a large database of programming contest problems. The operators of the site describe it as a social network for people interested in contest programming and as a platform for hosting programming contests \cite{WEBSITE:CF1}. Submissions submitted by a user available on the user's profile. The website has an API that can be used to collect user and submission information, but not to collect submission source code. However, the source code for user submissions is accessible through their profile. Codeforces is one of the more popular sites available for contest programming and regularly hosts contests. As of May 2019 there were over 180k users that had participated in at least one ranked contest.

%% Pros and cons of collecting from codeforces along with steps taken to try and overcome any issues. %%
\subsection{Pros And Cons}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Making the source code of user's solutions available for anyone to view is not common with programming contest websites. This makes Codeforces a valuable resource for this kind of programming.
    
    \item Codeforces is very popular among users in Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. There is more regional diversity than sites like GitHub that are more popular in North America.
    
    \item Users that participate in ranked contests have a rating that is adjusted based on their performance. This makes it possible to get an idea of a programmer's skill and experience.
    
    \item Users that choose to enter one have a first name. This makes it easier to use the first name to find gender of the programmer. This name is included in the list of users that is used to collect submissions. This allows the user list to be preprocessed for gender before it is run through a script to collect submissions.

    \item The way that solutions are stored makes it more difficult to automate their collection. The source code is stored in popups on the users submission page. So in order to access this code the popups must be opened first. Submissions are supposed to have links to individual pages to view the source code as well, but these links can very be unreliable.

    \item Submission source code must be scraped from the html. This means changes to the website that alter the html can cause data collection programs to require re-writes.

    \item Contest programming has very different purposes than more general kinds of programming. Its domain specific nature will be reflected in the source code samples form Codeforces. However, this means that the coders are less likely to adhere to any best practices or style guidelines. There may be even more variation in the coding style between authors. It may just require a different kind of feature selection than other kinds of programming.

    \item The ratio of men to women is quite skewed. It is not easy to find large numbers of female candidates from every country.
\end{itemize}

%% High level overview of the process %%
\subsection{Process Overview}
A request is made to the Codeforces API for all users that have participated in ranked contests. This user list is filtered to include only users with a country that gender information is available for. Sections of this new list are collected for specific countries and genders. Each user record of these smaller list is processed. For each user record submission information is collected for the user with the Codeforces API. If collected submission record meets certain conditions then an attempt is made to collect its source code. If the source code can be collected the source code, along with submission and user information, is added to the database.

    \caption{Getting Data From Codeforces}
\end{figure}


%% Discussion of each subprocess with technical details, the data collected, and the technical issues %%
\subsection{Process Details}
There are two processed used to collect the code. The most reliable is to use the Selenium web driver to open each users submission page to open popups that contain the source code and scrape it. The other way is to create links from user and submission records to a page that has the source code on it. These links seem work for short periods of time and then become unavailable for a slightly longer period. This makes it an unreliable method of collection to use on its own. Primarily collecting source code samples with the Selenium process and using links as a backup allows for most valid samples to be obtainable.

\subsubsection*{Process}
First a list of user records collected from the user records requested from the Codeforces API is loaded. Invalid user records are filtered out before the process is started so there is no need to validate the user records. For each user record a list of submission records is requested from the Codeforces API. When using Selenium only the most recent 50 submission records for a user are gathered because each page of submissions of Codeforces has 50 submissions per page. Only one submission for a problem is collected so a set of problem names for collected submissions is maintained. Before processing a user record the database is queried to add any previously collected problem names to this set.  The variations in submissions for the same problem are often minor for accepted solutions.

Before an attempt is made to collect source code for a submission it is validated. It must be an accepted solution for a problem that has not been collected for the current user. Team submissions are ignored as are non-programming submissions. It must also be written in one of the programming languages that is being collected.If a submission record does not meet these conditions then the process moves to the next submission.

The first attempt to collect the source code is done with the Selenium web driver. When the process starts a web browser is opened. For each user record the browser opens the users submissions page. On this page each submission's id is a link to open a popup containing the source code. The Selenium web driver can click this link and open the popup in the browser. Once the popup is open the pages html can be scraped and the source code is collected from it. Sometimes the submission id does not have a link available and the popup cannot be opened. When this happens another attempt is made using the second method.

The second attempt is made by taking some user, contest, and submission information and using it to construct a url. This url should lead to another page that has all the same information for the submission's source code. If this page is available to visit then its html is scraped and the source code collected from it. If the link does work and no source code can be obtained the process moves on to the next submission record.

If source code is collected it is added, along with selected information from the user and submission record, to the database. Each remaining submission record for the current user is processed. When all 50 submission records are processed, or a total of 50 submissions have been collected for the current user, next user record is processed.

When all user records are processed or a given limit for number of records to process is reached the process ends. Details on the range of records processed and the success rate for submissions and added source code samples are displayed.

\subsubsection*{Data}
Data is collected for the user and the submission. The required user information is Codeforces handle, first name, country, gender, gender probability, rank, and rating. All fields are strings except for gender probability which is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 and rating which is an integer. The handle is the users unique login name for Codeforces. The rank is a title that is given to users based on their overall ranking on the site. For example 'Expert' or 'Legendary Grand Master'. Rating is a number usually between 0 and 4000 and it determined the users overall ranking on the site. User information that may be present, but not required, is last name, city, organization, contribution, max rank, max rating, registration time. The first three are strings. contribution is a number and it has to do with a users activity in the Codeforces community. Max rank and max rating are the same as rank and rating, but represent the best of either the user has achieved. The registration time is a time stamp that indicates when the user signed up to codeforces.

All the submission information used is required except for problem difficulty which is not always available. The fields include a submission id, a problem name, a programming language, a participant type, and a submission time. Submission id is a unique integer identifier added to each submission by codeforces when the submission is made. The problem name is a string of the problem title. There are various participant types indicating what the user may have been doing when solving the problem. For example as a contestant or out of contests time. The time is a time stamp that is converted into integers for day, month, and year as well as a time string of the time of day. These new fields are stored in the database instead of the time stamp.

All Data collected from the API is in json format. It comes with more fields than are necessary for the process or for our research. Information on the API and additional fields can be found on the Codeforces website.

\subsubsection*{Technical Issues}
There are some technical issues with using selenium. Because Selenium loads the pages in a web browser the process must wait for the page to load fully before it can continue. This means that there are some sleeps in the code for a couple seconds before scraping a popup and before clicking the next submission link after closing the popup. This slows down collection, but the failure rate is low so it is acceptable.

The codeforces web site can often be slow to load, and sometime become unresponsive. The process deals with this by reloading the page if it has failed to load after 30 seconds. This often solves the issue without too many refreshes, but it can waste a couple minutes. Sometimes Selenium cannot find the popup close button and the submission page must be refreshed to process the next submission. If it must be refreshed several times before it is ready again it can cause even more waiting.

In the end Selenium works very well, but it increases the complexity of the process and the components involved. This can make it hard to deal with all the errors that might come up while interacting with a web browser directly. It is difficult to guarantee that the process will run it for long periods of time unattended.

The constructed links not always working is an issue. It can be possible to collect 20 submissions and then fail to collect 50 or more. It seems to be a rather regular pattern, but it is not clear what causes it. The plus side is that only using these links is far less complicated and has been left running for days at a time. It may skip certain users or require some kind of sleep to make sure that it misses a minimum of submissions, but it might be acceptable if it could be left running 24 hours a day.



% Gender Labeling %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Adding Gender Labels}
One of the sociolinguistic features that is important to the project is Gender. Unfortunately, gender is available for authors on GitHub or Codeforces. Since it cannot be collected along with author information gender must be obtained in other ways. This can be done using an authors first name. There are a number of websites and APIs available that offer gender data for first names. All the gender information for authors in the dataset were gathered in this way.

%% Introduction to the sources being used %%
\subsection{Sources}
There are several websites and APIs for adding gender for first names. They include gender-api.com, genderize.io, namsor.com, and nameapi.org. This project primarily used genderize.io because it is free and allows 1000 name lookups per day. In addition to this a table was kept in the database to store the names that were already known. The service offers a 'male', 'female', or 'unknown' verdict when given a name. It also gives a probability that a result is correct (from sample?). In addition it is possible to pass a country code to along with the name to obtain results that are more specific? The other APIs all offer similar services, but they all require monthly payment for more than a small number of name guesses.

%% Discussion of the pros and cons and difficulties along with steps taken to try and overcome any issues. %%
\subsection{Pros And Cons}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is really the only way to add gender labels to programmers without being able to ask them directly. Asking them directly would be a significant undertaking and most would be unlikely to respond.
    
    \item With several decent sources available for this kind of labeling it is possible to confirm results. If one has selected a portion of the dataset that meets their needs it would be possible to re-run the authors names through all the services and filter out any users that could not be agreed upon. This could improve the accuracy of the labels. Doing this with a smaller dataset would also reduce the cost of using services that require payment. Also, there are many names that are more common so the number of names needed will always be less than the number of authors in a dataset. This will further reduce the number of names to label and should mean that reasonable accuracy can be obtained for many common names.

    \item Inferring gender from names is not an easy task (some examples and sources). It is also not always very clear how a service is determining the gender \cite{Santamaria2018}. So this is immediately a problem. The probability given can help to determine the likelihood of results being correct, but it still is only as good as the service. There are some stats given by Santamaria \cite{Santamaria2018} that comment on the accuracy of the above 4 services.

    \item Aside from the accuracy of these methods being suspect, the major con is that for the most part they are paid services. Some of them do offer free limits, but only genderize is really worth it for any larger needs, and even then only with an offline backup of already labeled names. The good news is that there are many people sharing a small number of names, so a large number of samples can be labeled with a small database.

    \item People are not always truthful with their names on these profiles, sometimes they do not even give a name. As a result there are fewer samples to work with if gender is desired. If country is going to be used to add accuracy to the label then it lowers the number of samples available further.

    \item All services are less effective at labeling Asian names \cite{Santamaria2018}. This can present a problem for datasets that are using large numbers of samples from Asian countries.

    \item The number of samples can be low for a name so even if the probability is high it may not be accurate.

    \item The names collected show a much less accurate probability for female names. Most male names are classed as 0.9-1.0 and more female names fall into this category, but in some cases at most half of the names are in the 0.9-1.0 category. This suggests that there are some issues with classifying female names properly. Wether it is that more female names are unisex or that there are low samples for them is unknown (to me. Could use a table?).
    
    \item These methods of gender labeling are firmly rooted in the gender binary. The gender labels of names will be more likely to be connected to cultural norms and biological sex and may not accurately represent the individual' gender.

%% Overview of the process %%
\subsection{Process Details}
\subsubsection*{Process}
The process used for collecting gender for names is relatively simple. Given a name the database is checked to see if it has the name already. If the name is not in the database it is looked up with the genderize.io API. If the API returns a result that result is added with the name to the database. If the API limit has been reached then a appropriate (what?) response is given. The scripts all have options (Do they?) to save results for later processing if gender cannot be determined. If there name is able to be labeled then the label and the probability are returned.

The labels added to the scripts do not use country codes. As stated above it will be desireable to re-label the names on samples that are used by submitting the names and countries again to other APIs to see if results can be confirmed or refined. Because this will be done after it is likely that some authors will have been missed because they had unknown genders and so they were not added to the dataset. This may throw off the statistic of the samples a bit. The most important thing is to have enough good samples with reliable gender labels to use in experiments, so loosing a few users is acceptable. Better to have less data that is high quality than to have more data that is lower quality.

\subsubsection*{Data}
The data consists of just the gender and the probability the gender label is correct. The gender is a string 'male', 'female', or 'unknown' (Other APIs give different results). The probability is a float between 0.0 and 1.0. The Case of a name is ignored (is it?). There is also a 'count' field that is returned that is described as 'the number of entries examined to calculate the result' (cite). and if country code is given the country code is also part of the response. Also the name is part of the response.
