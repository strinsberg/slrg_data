SLRG Data Documentation (DRAFT)
===============================

The Project
-----------

Here there can be an introduction the the project. A nice high level overview explaining some of what is in the documentation. For example, what is in the report and what is on the web page itself.

Can link to the report/paper(s) that we have available |collection-report|. Perhaps eventually having a whole page devoted to them. A nice summary or something followed by a link to an actual pdf. That way you could also get to them from the table of contents and not just a link on this page.

Anything other higher level stuff can be mentioned or linked here. If need be we can also make a few more pages before the *Getting Started* page to put in other less technical information.

I suppose what we do here depends on the purpose of this documentation. If it is just to get new people on board and introduce them to the techniques and tools that we have used to build our dataset then probably less high level stuff will be needed. However, If we want people outside of those working on the project to use this then it may need some more explanations etc.
