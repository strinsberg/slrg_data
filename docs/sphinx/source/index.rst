SLRG Data Collection Documentation (DRAFT)
==========================================

This is the complete documentation for the data collection completed summer 2019 for Dr. Jackie Rice's Socioliguistics Reasearch group. It is a collection of information on the process of collecting source code from GitHub and Codeforces to be used in future research.

The information presented on this site is primarily a tutorial. It will give instruction on how to collect meta data from GitHub and Codeforces and run scripts on that meta data that will collect and add source code samples to our database. It also contains information on the python package that contains the scripts and API documentation for all the code. Lastly, there is some information on the database and some of the SQL we used to work with our database and BigQuery. is For a higher level overview of the process see the |collection-report|.
